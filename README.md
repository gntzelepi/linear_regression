A simple Machine Learning Project using Linear Regression. In this example, I am going to try to model the relationship between two variables, the Income and amount of Happiness someone has. So, the question I am trying to answer is, based on someone's Income can I successfully predict their number of Happiness, on a scale 0 to 10?
